   o Bugs correction for v1.0
   o Put all the logo plots on the same pic
   o Repeats : use the repeatmasker track but take into account the repeats position and length according to the consensus.
   o Add percentage of uniquely/multiple mapped reads on the R output
   o Plot all the logo (all/sens/antisens) on the same figure. Add the IC_SCALE option in the config file
   o Correct some color space bugs
   o In each run, keep the same Y axis for all samples to display base coverage in each ncRNA/repeat familiy 
   o To handle the problem of different of full length size ncRNA/repeat from the same family, the full length of each ncRNA/repeat-related consensus sequence is scaled to 1000, and reads that are mapped to this ncRNA/truncated repeat are caculated corresponding position and coverage in the scaled region. For displaying, the median size of all full length ncRNA/repeat consensus sequences is used to replace 1000 in x axis, and the corresponding size for position 200,400,600 and 800 are also calculated and shown in the figure.
   o For repeatMasker annotation,  extended items will only work on full length repeats
   o Modify the way to generate repeatMasker gff file to add repeat locations in consensus sequence

   o Normalisation (RPM) of all ncRNA count in bed file
   o Remove miRNAs from RFAM
   o Keep only Exp values for Rfam/repeat overview outputs
   o Normalize reads count (RPM) for UCSC visualization
   o Merge sense and antisense bed file from significant region analyses into one bed with strand information
   o Set grouping as an option for both raw read input and bam file input
   o HTML report version 1.0
   o Create the checkConfig.sh script to check the system path of the tools used by the pipeline. Add the systemCheck option to the makefile.
   o Change annotation organization. Update of all human and mouse annotation files
   o ProcessReads.pl. Check the raw data input format
   o Change plotRfamClassOverviewCt.R to have the same colors in Exp and Ct outputs
   o Add the mirna_stat command to generate the barplot with the percentage of annotated miRNAs
   o Change the plotSingleFamInfo.R plots. Merge the size distribution plots in one graph
   o Change the output names of ncrna_ucsc_track. 'plus/minus' changed in 'sens/antisens'
   o famReadCov.pl command line. Add the field "ID" to work with the miRNA precursor gff file
   o Force the langage 'export LANG=C' in the configuration file to avoid problems with the decimal forat in awk outputs

   o Make a few small changes of the section orgnization in the pipeline
   o Add two scripts to annotation/parseAnnotationFiles/generate_rfamGff/ which could be used to generate rfam annotation file for new genome version
