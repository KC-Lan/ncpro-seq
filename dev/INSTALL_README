0. Read the manual in the 'manual' folder or look at http://ncpro.curie.fr/manuals.html

1. Make sure that R has been successfully installed in your system. If you want to use the interface version of ncPRO-seq, a local server with php is also required before the ncPRO-seq installation. 
Please refer to section 7 in the manual for more details of these two softwares.


2. Download and extract pre-built bowtie genome index files from bowtie website or build your own genome indexes by following the instructions in bowtie website. 
The path of bowtie indexes will be demanded during the following ncPRO-seq installation.


3. Download the source of the latest version of ncPRO-seq and annotation files of different species from sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ncproseq/files/). 
For example, we choose source code ncPRO-seq.v1.5.0.tar.gz from src folder and annotation file mouse mm9.tar.gz from annotation folder in the ncPRO-seq download page in sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ncproseq/files/). 
Then go to the directory where you save downloaded files in your shell prompt, do the following steps to extract files and to put annotation files into the source folder.
   
> tar -zxvf mouse_mm9.tar.gz
> tar -zxvf ncPRO-seq.v1.6.1.tar.gz
> mv mm9 ncPRO-seq.v1.6.1/annotation/
